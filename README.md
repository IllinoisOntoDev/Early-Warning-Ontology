# Domain Description 

## Scope of the proposed area
With the advent of new geospatial technologies, tracking real-time criminal activities has become a prevalent practice. Some existing platforms such as [Criminal Reports](https://www.crimereports.com/) provides such statistics and data within a period of time; while governmental warning systems (e.g. Illini alert) receives criminal activity reports and sends warning messages via text messages or social media. However, these warning systems usually still deferred a little when sending out the warnings; and the messages are sent to the mass public when in real life they could have just send relevant message to the selected areas that were affected.

In this research, I would like to develop a geospatial ontology for tracking real-time criminal activities. With the help of ontologies, we may be able to:
(1)	Use the reasoning methods in ontologies and infer the ‘affected’ zones of the criminal activities 
(2)	Use the time-related classes and properties to track the activities without time-delay
